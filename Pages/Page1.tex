\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{The Impact of Excessive Meetings}
Numerous studies highlight the adverse effects of too many meetings on organizational outcomes. A study by Allen and Rogelberg (2013) ~\cite{09} found a negative correlation between the frequency of meetings and employee job satisfaction. Additionally, prolonged exposure to excessive meetings is linked to heightened levels of workplace stress and decreased overall productivity  ~\cite{10}.
\subsection{Factors Contributing to Excessive Meetings}
Understanding the root causes of excessive meetings is crucial for developing effective strategies. In environments where face-to-face communication is overly valued ~\cite{11}, the tendency to call unnecessary meetings increases.
\subsection{Best Practices for Effective Meetings}
The literature consistently advocates for specific practices to enhance the efficiency of meetings. A meta-analysis by Wang et al. (2023) ~\cite{12} highlighted the importance of setting clear objectives for each meeting. When participants understand the purpose, meetings tend to be more focused and shorter. Moreover, a publication in PMC by Leach et al. (2009) reported that a written agenda and completion of all planned agenda items during the meeting are two design characteristics that influence the perception of a meeting as a good meeting ~\cite{13}.

\subsection{Technology and Alternative Communication Channels}
Technological advances provide alternatives to face-to-face meetings. Global tech infrastructure evolution prompts organizations to harness virtual learning, collaborative tools, and media for enhanced knowledge generation in project management, controlling experiences and situations effectively. ~\cite{14}.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=120mm,height=62mm,scale=1]{TAS/Images/CommunicationStrategies.png}\\
\end{center}
The above approach mentions incorporating information and communication technologies that address members’ communication needs and circumvent biases. For example, one could develop discussion boards to
facilitate equality of input on the part of all members. An understanding of the task will facilitate the negotiation of availability and exchange of information critical to success. 

\subsection{Meeting Policies and Guidelines}
Several studies advocate for the implementation of explicit meeting policies and guidelines. A comprehensive review by Raphaela Brandner through 10 Meeting Rules to Host Productive and Effective Meetings ~\cite{15} analyzed the effects of instituting policies related to meeting frequency, duration, and necessity. Organizations that established clear guidelines experienced a notable decrease in unnecessary meetings, leading to improvements in overall productivity and employee satisfaction.

\subsection{Employee Perspectives and Feedback}
Understanding the perceptions of employees regarding meetings is crucial. A qualitative study by Maureen L. Mackenzie. (2010) ~\cite{16} seeks to uncover the expectations that have yet to be clearly defined within the manager–employee relationship. By delving into the shifting dynamics of communication and trust within this digital framework, the intended outcome is to reveal the uncharted territory and expectations that characterize the evolving relationship between managers and employees in the digital age.

\subsection{Implementation Strategies}
To cut meeting numbers effectively, secure leadership support, with leaders modeling new communication methods. Implement changes gradually for organizational adaptability, fostering a culture where employees readily embrace shifts in meeting practices.

\subsection{Evaluation and Measurement}
Measuring the success of initiatives to reduce meetings is crucial for ongoing improvement. Metrics such as meeting duration, employee satisfaction, and productivity levels are commonly used. Regular evaluations, coupled with feedback mechanisms, enable organizations to refine their strategies and address emerging challenges.

\subsection{Gaps in the Literature}
While existing research provides valuable insights, several gaps remain. Limited studies have explored the long-term effects of reduced meeting frequency on team dynamics and organizational culture. Additionally, more research is needed to understand the cultural nuances that influence meeting behaviors in diverse settings, including universities.
